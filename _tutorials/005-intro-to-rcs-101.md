**Containers** let you install software and run applications just like you would on a normal server, but instead of having multiple applications sharing the same server directly, each one is tucked away into a sandbox. This sandbox is achieved by using several features that are already built into the Linux kernel.

**Docker** provides a standard interface that makes building, running, and sharing containers relatively easy. Ironically, the most difficult part of using Docker is just getting it installed in the first place.

#What is Rackspace Container Service?#
**Rackspace Container Service** helps you get a quick start with Docker and containers. RCS has been designed to make running and managing containers easier for you. It does so by focusing on the essentials: fast provisioning times, bare-metal performance, and an easy-to-use user inerface. Rackspace Container Service provides the following benefits for users:

* Provides an infrastructure for cluster management.
* Manages the scaling of your pool of Docker nodes 
* Enables you to utilize all the benefits of containers (packaging and performance)
* Supports new use-cases with extremely dynamic application lifecycles
* Enables you to quickly go from zero to a running appliation 
 
##Before you get started##
Before you get started with Rackspace Container Service, you should do the following:

* Ensure that your Rackspace Cloud account is enabled for Rackspace Container Services.
* Familiarize yourself with basic Docker concepts. Read the `Docker documentation`_.
* Familiarize yourself with the basic container concepts. Read the Containers 101 (add link) document.
* Familiarize yourself with scheduling strategies (`Strategy`) and with filters (`Filters`).
* Learn about the resources and resource limitations of a cluster.
* Install the Docker client on your computer:
  * For installation instructions, see the :ref:`Install the Docker client <Install Docker Client>` section.
* If you already have the Docker client installed, ensure that you have the right version. Rackspace Container Service, currently supports Docker version 1.8.2.
