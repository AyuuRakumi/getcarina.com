Carina provisions Docker Swarm clusters for users to deploy their containers to.
Although these clusters offer much of the native functionality you usually get
with Docker Swarm, there are certain differences between native Docker and Carina
that you should be aware of.

### Carina segments

Docker Swarm uses the concept of a "host" to represent a machine that runs a
Docker daemon and can store containers. In Carina, the concept is almost
identical, but the term is "segment".

A Carina segment is similar to a Docker host, since both of them host a set of
Docker containers given to them by the Swarm scheduler. One of the key differences,
however, is their underlying virtualization technology. A segment is an LXC
container provisioned by libvirt, whereas a Docker host is typically a virtual
machine provisioned by docker-machine. Tests have shown a 60% performance boost
when using LXC containers instead of VM hosts.

Due to the fact that your Docker containers will live on segments, you cannot
SSH into the Swarm host like you can a traditional VM. There are also
restrictions on mounting paths from the host filesystem, which is discussed in
greater detail in the [Volumes](#volumes) section below.

Each segment is assigned a public IPv4 address like a normal Docker host. You
can see all of these with `docker info` or by reading the tip in the
[Retrieve your Swarm discovery token](#retrieve-your-swarm-discovery-token)
section below.

Each segment has 2 GB of memory and roughly the equivalent of 2 vCPUs. The 
maximum number of segments you can provision per cluster is 3. The maximum
number of clusters you are allowed per account is 3.

### CLI creation

The usual way you provision a Swarm cluster is via the command-line. You will
usually expect to:

- Generate a discovery token
- Provision the Swarm manager
- Add a set of Swarm nodes with the Swarm agent installed

But with Carina, this is all handled for you, meaning that you skip this
initial set up. Instead, you use the Carina control panel to deploy, manage,
and visualise your clusters.

### Discovery backends

Swarm uses the concept of a discovery backend to keep track of all the hosts
registered on the cluster. There are many different kinds of discovery backends
in use through the Docker ecosystem:

- Hosted Discovery with Docker Hub
- Using static files
- etcd
- zookeeper
- consul

You can even use a static list of IP addresses, or IP ranges, instead. With
Carina, however, the only supported option is Hosted Discovery with Docker Hub.
Each cluster is assigned its own Discovery token ID, and hosts use Docker Hub
for service discovery.

#### Retrieve your Swarm discovery token

To retrieve your discovery token, you can run:

```
docker inspect -f "{{index .Config.Cmd 6}}" $(docker ps -aq -f name=swarm-manager -n 1)
```

This command will inspect the `Cmd` configuration of any container it can find
first named `swarm-manager`. This is because that these manager containers,
when first run, are provided with the unique token ID - so all we are doing here
is retrieving the original command use to provision the manager container.

To list of the Swarm nodes in your cluster, run:

```
swarm list $(docker inspect -f "{{index .Config.Cmd 6}}" $(docker ps -aq -f name=swarm-manager -n 1))
```

See the [installation instruction](https://github.com/docker/swarm#installation-for-swarm-developers)
for information about how to install and use the `swarm` binary.

### Scheduling strategies

The Docker Swarm scheduler can distribute containers to hosts in different ways,
and it allows you to specify them when a manager is provisioned. You do this
by passing the `--strategy` flag to the `swarm manage` command.

With Carina you do not get this option: the `spread` strategy is used (the
  Swarm default).

###Â AppArmor profiles

Carina builds on the standard restrictions set out by
[libcontainer](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/master/libcontainer/SPEC.md#security)
by using an AppArmor profile as an additional security layer. Specifically, it:

- denies access to sensitive file paths on the hosts (such as system files and
  mount locations)
- whitelists expected mount calls for the container filesystem
- restricts the device capabilities of the Docker process

### Privileged and capability run flags

By default, Docker containers cannot access any devices on the host. If, however,
the `--privileged` flag is used with the `docker run` command, it allows the
container to access all of the devices on the host as if it were a normal process.
Due to security concerns, Carina disallows this and forces all containers to run
in unprivileged mode.

In line with Linux conventions, Docker uses capabilities to restrict the behavior
of containers. Operations can override these security rules using the `--cap-add`
and `--cap-drop` flags to add fine grain control. Carina disallows this.

### Volumes

One of the features of Docker containers is the ability to mount directories
from the host machine, but with Carina this is disabled for security. This
means that you cannot use the `--volume` flag when referring to host paths.

What you can use instead is a data volume container. To find out more information,
read our [Introduction to Data Volume containers]() article.

### TLS certificates

All TLS certificates for a cluster are made available on each host through the
`swarm-data` container. To access them, you should use `--volumes-from swarm-data`
with the `docker run` command. The certificates will then be available inside the
container in the following paths:

```
/etc/docker/ca.pem
/etc/docker/server-cert.pem
/etc/docker/server-key.pem
```
