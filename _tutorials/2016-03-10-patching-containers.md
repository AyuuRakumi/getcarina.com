One of the unique advantages of Docker containers is the ability it gives
developers to tightly scope and lock down the dependencies of applications.
The result being that whenever security vulnerabilities are detected and patches
released, rolling those changes out is easier, since there is a smaller footprint
of dependencies which need attention.

In this tutorial we will cover the basics of how to detect, patch, and redeploy
containers running out-of-date Docker images.

##Â Step 1. Rebuilding custom images

If you are using an official Docker image hosted on Docker Hub, you can go
straight to the [Step 3](#step-3-redeploy-containers).

If you are using a custom image for your Docker containers, you will need to
rebuild the image. Due to the nature of Docker's UnionFS, this can be achieved
relatively quickly, since your application's filesystem will be re-layered on
top of the updated base layer, rather than rebuilt from scratch.

To rebuild your image, you will need to run:

```bash
$ docker build --pull --tag <dockerhub-user>/<custom-image> .
```

If you are using a custom registry, please remember to substitute the
`<dockerhub-user>` for your registry URL and port;
for example: `localhost:5000/wordpress`.

## Step 2. Push rebuilt image to a registry

If you are not hosting your custom images in a registry (either private or
Docker Hub), you can skip this step and go straight to [Step 3](#step-3-redeploy-containers).

Before pushing, you will need to sign in using your Docker Hub credentials:

```bash
$ docker login
Username: <dockerhub-user>
Password: <dockerhub-password>
Email: <dockerhub-email>
WARNING: login credentials saved in ~/.docker/config.json
Login Succeeded
```

Once you have a local version of your patched image, you can then push it to
your registry of choice:

```bash
$ docker push <dockerhub-user>/<custom-image>
```

For more information about how to work with images on Docker Hub, please
read our [Using Docker Hub](https://getcarina.com/docs/troubleshooting/run-container-using-custom-image/#use-docker-hub)
 guide.

## Step 3. Redeploy containers

The final step is to redeploy all the out-of-date containers using the patched
image which have just pushed. Due to the onerous nature of this task, as well
as the multitude of ways it can be done, for the sake of this tutorial we will
be using a container running Watchtower.

Watchtower runs in a container and continually monitors all of the source
images which are used by containers across Docker hosts. If it detects that a
container is running an out-of-date image it will attempt to gracefully shut
it down by sending it a `SIGTERM` signal. This will allow it to handle remaining
traffic and be retired. A new container is then started, using the same
runtime configuration as its predecessor.

To run watchtower:

```bash
$ docker run --detach \
  --name watchtower \
  --volumes-from swarm-data \
  --env DOCKER_HOST=$DOCKER_HOST \
  carina/watchtower \
  --tlsverify \
  --tlscacert=/etc/docker/ca.pem \
  --tlskey=/etc/docker/server-key.pem \
  --tlscert=/etc/docker/server-cert.pem \
  --interval 30
```

This will create a container named `watchtower` which will connect to the
Swarm endpoint using the TLS certificates made available via the
`swarm-data` container. It will poll Docker Hub every 30 seconds. If this is
too often or infrequent, feel free to adjust this value.

You can monitor updates by viewing the logs:

```bash
$ docker logs watchtower
time="2016-03-16T00:30:31Z" level=info msg="Checking containers for updated images"
time="2016-03-16T00:30:31Z" level=debug msg="Retrieving running containers"
time="2016-03-16T00:30:36Z" level=debug msg="Pulling wordpress:latest for /adoring_roentgen"

time="2016-03-16T00:30:31Z" level=debug msg="Removing container 532d7b7deb95f64f282b8ec42217f92ffe50ca28319a7e2b540922efc9562864"
```
