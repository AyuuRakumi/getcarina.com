This article provides some solutions for common problems that you might encounter while using Carina. It also provides links to help for other issues.

### Is your Docker daemon up and running?

If your environment isn't configured properly, you might get the following error message when attempting to run any `docker` command:

```
Get http:///var/run/docker.sock/v1.20/info: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: no such file or directory.
* Are you trying to connect to a TLS-enabled daemon without TLS?
* Is your docker daemon up and running?
```

To resolve this error, ensure that you have gone through each step of [Connect to your cluster]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/create-connect-cluster#connect-to-your-cluster).

### Error response from daemon: client and server don't have same version

If there is a version mismatch between your Docker client and your Carina cluster, you might get the following error message:

```
Error response from daemon: client and server don't have same version (client : x.xx, server: x.xx)`
```

To resolve this error:

1. Install the [Docker Version Manager (dvm)][dvm].
2. [Load your cluster credentials][carina-creds].
3. Run `dvm use`. This switches your Docker client to the same version used by your cluster.

### Cannot connect to the Docker daemon

The following error indicates one of two possible issues:

```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon. Is "docker -d" running on this host?
```  
1. You're behind a firewall or VPN and it's blocking port 2376 (a port used by Docker). To resolve this error, request your network administrator to open that port or retry your actions from a location where port 2376 isn't blocked.

2. You've accidentally removed the Docker Swarm management containers. To resolve this error:

Via the GUI:
  1. Login to the [control panel](https://app.getcarina.com)
  1. Under the gear icon for the affected cluster, click "Edit Cluster"
  1. Under the Actions button, click "Rebuild Cluster"  

Via the CLI:
1. [Download and install the Carina CLI](https://getcarina.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-carina-cli/#download-and-install-the-carina-cli)
1. Run then `carina rebuild <cluster-name>` command

For more information, see [What does the cluster rebuild action do?](https://getcarina.com/docs/faq/#what-does-the-cluster-rebuild-action-do).

### Debug a running container

You can enter a running container to investigate and debug what's happening inside the container. The following command starts an interactive shell in the latest container run:

```bash
$ docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -l) /bin/bash
```

### nsenter: Failed to open ns file /proc/xxxxxx/ns for ns ipc: Permission denied

If you run `docker exec` on a container that runs a process that exits, you get an error message. For example:

```bash
$ docker run --name test -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql
bbfce65817c7fe76a1137aa984ec50bf79378343ef70f3f5593f16b038a9f1fe

$ docker exec test echo "Yay! :)" || echo "Aw Man :("
nsenter: Failed to open ns file /proc/27625/ns for ns ipc: Permission denied
Aw Man :(
```

The key to the fix is that the original image runs a process that exits (in this case, `./entrypoint.sh mysqld`). Instead, run `tail â€“f /dev/null` at the end, which will never exit and thus preserve `pid 1` and allow `docker exec` to continue working. For example:

```bash
$ docker rm -f test
test

$ docker run --name test -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d --entrypoint /bin/bash mysql -c "./entrypoint.sh mysqld && tail -f /dev/null"
0d01fc4fe1ca53ca98f5f6a3d6ae634467b590523d7b9b3c7053e1d2244339bc

$ docker exec test echo "Yay! :)" || echo "Aw Man :("
Yay! :)
```

### Cannot start container xxxxxx: [8] System error: permission denied

If you attempt to bind mount a volume from the host using a volume flag of the form `--volume host-dir:container-dir`, you get an error message. For example,

```bash
$ docker run --rm --volume $HOME/src/config:/src/config cirros echo "Hello"
Timestamp: 2015-11-09 19:46:32.746407404 +0000 UTC
Code: System error

```

This error occurs because of security restrictions on Carina. To resolve this error, see the section on [Volumes]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/docker-swarm-carina/#volumes) in [Understanding how Carina uses Docker Swarm]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/docker-swarm-carina/).

### Old PowerShell version on Windows

If you are running PowerShell version 2 or less, the $PSScriptRoot variable in docker.ps1 is not supported and you get the following error message:

```
PS C:\Users\username\Desktop\mycluster> docker info
Could not read CA certificate "C:\\Users\\username\\.docker\\ca.pem": open C:\Users\username\.docker\ca.pem: The system cannot find the file specified.
```

To resolve this error, upgrade PowerShell to version 3 or above.
