It's the fourth week of January and all that health data you got over the holidays is simply waiting to be studied! Let's see how we can make our own health data dashboards using the Jawbone UP API on node.js. I know my intent is to sleep more in 2016. So, how about a chart of my sleeping habits? Thanks Jawbone!

This post offers a walk-through using Carina and Let's Encrypt along with a Jawbone UP example to make an app called Sleepify. Once you log in, the app displays a table with your daily sleep amounts.

First, the code itself is in https://github.com/annegentle/JawboneUPNodeDemo. This is from a tutorial on [Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/connecting-jawbone-up-api-node-js/).

### Get ready: prerequisites

To go through this example, clone my fork of the JawboneUPNodeDemo repo. To read your own data, you'll need a Jawbone UP and an account on their site. To go through this demo, create a Jawbone Developer account on https://jawbone.com/up/developer by clicking Sign In.

Register your app on the Jawbone developer portal. Mine is called sleepify with a silly Zzz icon.

![BuildAndDeploy]({% asset_path 2016-01-24-carina-jawbone/justwriteclickapps.png %})

Register a domain name for the public IP you get from Carina. The tutorial shows you how to get the IP address below.

### Get your Carina cluster

1. Create a Carina cluster for the node server container. The cluster in this example is called `sleepify`; yours will have a different name.

```
carina create sleepify
```

1. Get the credentials for it with the `carina` CLI.

```
$ carina credentials sleepify
```

1. Set these variables for your environment.

```
$ carina env sleepify
$ eval $(carina env sleepify)
```

### Create the app container

Create the app container with a `Dockerfile` that has node as its base. You can find this Dockerfile in the JawboneUPNodeDemo directory.

```
FROM node:4

MAINTAINER Anne Gentle <annegentle@justwriteclick.com>

# Create app directory

RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install app dependencies

COPY package.json /usr/src/app
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app files

COPY . /usr/src/app

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["npm", "start"]

```

Build the image. Make sure you are in the JawboneUPDemo directory containing the `Dockerfile`, and then run this command:

```
$ docker build -t="annegentle/jawbone-demo" .
```

Run the image, replacing the variables enclosed in `<>` with your domain and Jawbone developer credentials:

```
$ docker run --detach \
  --name jawbone-demo \
  --env DOMAIN=<domain> \
  --env JAWBONE_ID=<id> \
  --env JAWBONE_SECRET=<secret> \
  annegentle/jawbone-demo
```

```
npm info it worked if it ends with ok
npm info using npm@2.14.12
npm info using node@v4.2.5
npm info prestart JawboneUpNodeDemo@0.0.1
npm info start JawboneUpNodeDemo@0.0.1

> JawboneUpNodeDemo@0.0.1 start /usr/src/app
> node server.js

UP server listening on 5000
```

Get the IP address for the node server. You need this for registering the domain name through your registrar. 

```
$ echo $DOCKER_HOST
tcp://172.99.73.34:2376
```

Go to your domain registrar and add the IP address from Carina as A Records. Here's an example screenshot:

![BuildAndDeploy]({% asset_path 2016-01-24-carina-jawbone/arecords.png %})

### Create the certificates container for HTTPS

Launch a second container so that the app has HTTPS access, because HTTPS is a requirement from Jawbone. To get https through Let's Encrpyt, we'll go through [this tutorial](https://getcarina.com/blog/push-button-lets-encrypt/).

Weâ€™ll use those certs, by making another container with your Jawbone app container named "sleepifyapp" as the backend. The image `smashwilson/lets-nginx` is from the [Carina Push Button Let's Encrypt tutorial](https://getcarina.com/blog/push-button-lets-encrypt/).

Get the name of the container with `docker ps -a` to use in the `docker run` command. In the example for this tutorial, it's "sleepifyapp". 

The example below uses `--env STAGING=1`, which is a recommendation from the Let's Encrypt tutorial. This setting lets you make many certificates without hitting their limit. The cert won't be trusted in the browser until you remove `STAGING=1` when running this docker command.

```
$ docker run --detach \
  --name lets-nginx \
  --link jawbone-demo \
  --env EMAIL=annegentle@example.com \
  --env DOMAIN=sleepify.me \
  --env UPSTREAM=jawbone-demo:5000 \
  --env STAGING=1 \
  --publish 80:80 \
  --publish 443:443 \
  smashwilson/lets-nginx

4cf44cec7e139a62da3e544b7cb66c7623437700a632c2659cdf6672f794ae6e
```

You get back a container ID, and you can see the progress of the creation by checking the logs for that container ID:

```
$ docker logs 4cf
```

At first, you'll see this note in the logs:

```
Generating DH parameters, 2048 bit long safe prime, generator 2
This is going to take a long time
```

It really only takes a few minutes, but sit back and relax for your certs to be generated.

Once you see this set of notes in the container logs, you're good to proceed.

```IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - If you lose your account credentials, you can recover through
   e-mails sent to annegentle@gmail.com.
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/sleepify.me/fullchain.pem. Your cert will
   expire on 2016-04-24. To obtain a new version of the certificate in
   the future, simply run Let's Encrypt again.
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Let's Encrypt
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Let's
   Encrypt so making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
 - If you like Let's Encrypt, please consider supporting our work by:

   Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt:   https://letsencrypt.org/donate
   Donating to EFF:                    https://eff.org/donate-le

Ready
crond: crond (busybox 1.23.2) started, log level 8
```

Now, when you go to the domain name you made the A Records for, if you used `STAGING=1`, you get an error, "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID" because the Let's Encrypt staging server is issuing staging certs. In Chrome, click Advanced, and then click Proceed to <domainname> (unsafe) to try out your new site. Once you're ready to generate real certificates, remove the `STAGING=1` from the docker run command above and re-run.

You should get a dashboard login page like so:

![BuildAndDeploy]({% asset_path 2016-01-24-carina-jawbone/jawbonedashboard.png %})

Click Login to enter your Jawbone credentials. 

![BuildAndDeploy]({% asset_path 2016-01-24-carina-jawbone/jawboneauth.png %})

The app retrieves your sleep data and displays it in a simple table.

![BuildAndDeploy]({% asset_path 2016-01-24-carina-jawbone/jawbonesleepdata.png %})

### What's next?

If you're interested in building more Jawbone data dashboards, explore their documented API to find some more resources you could display. I'll look into my [workout data](https://jawbone.com/up/developer/endpoints) next. To explore more endpoints, modify the `server.js` file to build additional tables for your dashboard. Have fun and let us know how Carina got you started quickly with health data.
