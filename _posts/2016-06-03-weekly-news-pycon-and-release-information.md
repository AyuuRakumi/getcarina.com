### Docker 1.11.1 and Release Notes

Docker put out a patch release about a month ago and we wanted to make sure and highlight that today.  The release fixes some bugs that were reported after the 1.11.0 release.  The change log can be found [here](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases/tag/v1.11.1) and a side by side comparison of the different versions can be found [here](https://github.com/docker/docker/compare/v1.11.0...v1.11.1).  Changes include a chunk of runtime fixes and also includes aspect concerning networking, documentation, builder, and distribution.
Along with Docker we also have improved our error messages related to security restrictions.  More information can be found on our [error codes](https://getcarina.com/docs/reference/error-codes/) page.
