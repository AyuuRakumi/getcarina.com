### Pycon Wrap Up

We had a great showing at our Carina workshop and our booth at PyCon.  Everett Toews and Ash Wilson provided a [workshop](https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/2263/) "Deploy an Interactive Data Science Environment With Jupyterhub On Docker Swarm" to a captive audience.  If you're thinking "Dang! I wish I had been able to attend," you're in luck!  You can view and follow along with the presentation by accessing the deck [here](http://getcarina.github.io/jupyterhub-tutorial/slides/#/welcome).  Happy hacking!

### Docker 1.11.1 and Release Notes

Docker put out a patch release about a month ago and we had a quick follow by implementing these changes into Carina on May 23rd.  The release fixes some bugs that were reported after the 1.11.0 release.  The change log can be found [here](https://github.com/docker/docker/releases/tag/v1.11.1) and a side by side comparison of the different versions can be found [here](https://github.com/docker/docker/compare/v1.11.0...v1.11.1).  Changes include a chunk of runtime fixes and also includes aspect concerning networking, documentation, builder, and distribution.

Along with Docker we also have improved our error messages related to security restrictions.  More information can be found on our [error codes](https://getcarina.com/docs/reference/error-codes/) page.
