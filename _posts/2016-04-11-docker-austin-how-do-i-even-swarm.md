{{ page.excerpt }} I've since changed the title to Effective Docker Swarm.

This is a meetup I've been attending for the past year and know everyone pretty well already. If you're in the Austin area, you're always welcome to join us at [Docker Austin](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Austin/). Thursday night was an audience of 40-50 and they were highly engaged to say the least. I got a lot of great, detailed questions on Carina and Swarm during the talk. I literally spent twelve minutes on the Carina architecture slide while getting peppered with questions.

Here's the video.

The slide deck contains a fair amount of code and commands that you can follow. Use the left/right keys or swipe left/right to navigate.

I also got a lot of feedback on the presentation itself at the end, which was very helpful. I'm going to rework it a bit.

I'm going to put more emphasis on:

* Delineation of Carina and Swarm
* Benefits of Carina
* The competitive landscape (Swarm vs Kubernetes vs Mesos)

I'm going to put less emphasis on:

* Carina implementation details
 * An interesting subject but too easy to get bogged down
 * Takes emphasis away from developing and deploying apps on Carina
 * Better to say "Let's chat about it after the presentation"

Overall it was a great meetup and I really learned a lot from the audience.

If you're in Austin on April 26 (perhaps for the OpenStack Summit), join the Carina team at the Rackspace Cantina using this [free invite](http://www.cvent.com/d/pfq4wl/4W). You can hear from myself on Effective Docker Swarm, Ross Kukulinski of Yodlr on Using Carina in Production, and Tim Hockin of Google on Pain Management for Containerized Apps. Grab a t-shirt, have a drink and a bite to eat, and chat containers with us.
