We've done [Pip-Boy discovery and relay]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/fallout-4-service-discovery-and-relay/) and
[created new libraries]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/decoding-the-pipboy-database-with-vault-community/). Now let's put them to good use.

Things we'll cover:

* Drawing on canvas
* RxJS
* React
* Socket.io
* Turning many datapoints into a PNG
