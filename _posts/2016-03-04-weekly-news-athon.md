Round things up, round things out, it's time to share what's happening in Carina land.

## glibc and OpenSSL

On February 16, Google [posted about a buffer overflow in glibc that can result in remote execution](https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2016/02/cve-2015-7547-glibc-getaddrinfo-stack.html). The post itself is a great read, check it out. Additionally, OpenSSL has [released new versions that address several severe security issues](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2016-February/000063.html).

For your own security, we recommend pulling new versions of each image that you use and starting new containers.

## Distributed tic-tac-toe

Last week, Keith taught you how to [build a real-time game on Carina using RethinkDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/build-real-time-game-carina/). Have you played yet?

## Edit on GitHub for blog posts and docs

You can now click **Edit on GitHub**, on posts and articles to go straight to the GitHub page for editing, even for this page! Our editor told me that it was completely fine to make typos all over this pge on purpose.

## Reactive map building

Yesterday, I put out another post in a series of posts on RxJS and Fallout, this time on [simulating a multiplayer map]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/lets-build-a-reactive-map/). If you enjoyed going through it, [let me know](https://twitter.com/rgbkrk) if you would like to see more.

## JupyterHub on Carina

In the last couple of weeks we've [put together a workshop on Docker, Swarm, Carina,
and deploying JuypterHub to Carina](https://github.com/getcarina/jupyterhub-tutorial). Check it out when you get a chance!
