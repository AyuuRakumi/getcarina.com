Round things up, round things out, it's time to share what's happening in carina land.

## glibc and OpenSSL

TL;DR - Re-roll every image you are running

On February 16, Google [posted about a buffer overflow in glibc that can result in remote execution](https://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2016/02/cve-2015-7547-glibc-getaddrinfo-stack.html). The post itself is a great read, check it out. Additionally, OpenSSL has [released new versions that address several severe security issues](https://mta.openssl.org/pipermail/openssl-announce/2016-February/000063.html).

For your own safety and sanity, it's worth pulling new versions of each image you use and starting new containers.

## Distributed tic-tac-toe

Last week Keith put together how to [build a real time game on carina]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/build-real-time-game-carina/).

## Edit on GitHub for blog posts and docs

You can now click "Edit" on posts and docs to get straight to the GitHub page for editing this page! Our editor told me that it was completely fine to make typos all over this pge on purpose.

## Reactive map building

Yesterday I put out another in a series of posts on RxJS and Fallout, this time on [simulating a multiplayer map]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/lets-build-a-reactive-map/).

## JupyterHub on Carina

In the last couple of weeks we've [put together a workshop on Docker, Swarm, Carina,
and deploying JuypterHub to Carina](https://github.com/getcarina/jupyterhub-tutorial). Check it out when you get a chance!
