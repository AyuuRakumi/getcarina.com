Let's encrypt ASP.NET and IRC. Oops, that came out wrong. We've got some excellent new tutorials on using NGINX with Let's Encrypt, getting started with ASP.NET with Visual Studio, publishing an ASP.NET website from the command line, and using Quassel (distributed IRC client). Also news from the world of Docker.

## Error running a container using a custom image

<img class="right" src="{% asset_path weekly-news/affinity.png %}" alt="affinity"/> This new troubleshooting guide by the excellent [Carolyn Van Slyck](https://twitter.com/carolynvs) covers something *everyone* gets confused by at once dealing with multiple independent Docker Swarm hosts/nodes (Carina Clusters & Segments). "Error response from daemon: Error: image library/<custom-image> not found" is a fairly cryptic error. <img class="left" src="{% asset_path weekly-news/confused.gif %}" alt="confused"/>

Carolyn gives you plenty of options to fix / work around this in the tutorial including:

* Use image affinity scheduling with Docker Swarm
* Use Docker Hub (cheater!)
* Use another public Docker registry
* Use a private Docker registry

Check it out: [Running a container using a custom image]({{ site.baseurl }}/troubleshooting/run-container-using-custom-image/)

## Use Mumble on Carina

Next up; Mumble is a low-latency, multiplatform voice chat software. I remember using it mostly for... well World of Warcraft (don't ask) and Counter Strike but Zack Shoylev shows us how to use it in Docker making it easy to run Murmur in a portable way.

If you like talking with people (it's a life-choice) then check it out - mumble is encrypted voice communications, and if you mesh it with magically renewing TLS certificates via [NGINX with Let's Encrypt]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tutorials/nginx-with-lets-encrypt/) it should get you +10 points to house tinfoil! <img class="left" src="{% asset_path weekly-news/tinfoil.jpg %}" alt="tinfoil"/>
