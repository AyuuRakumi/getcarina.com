# Rackspace Container Service

This [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) repository houses documentation and tutorials for Rackspace Container Service.

## Installation
You can install Jekyll either by using the following instructions or, if you have Docker Toolbox installed, by running `script/preview`.

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
1. Clone this repository.
1. From the cloned repo, run `bundle install`.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`.
1. Navigate your web browser to the URL the command displays.

Jekyll is now serving this repo as a simple website, and will re-build the site every time you save a file.

## Writing

The content is split into three separate collections: **tutorials**, **best practices**, and **references**. The individual files for these collections are in `_tutorials`, `_best-practices`, and `_references`, respectively.

Right now, file names are being prefixed with a number like `001-` to control their display order. This is not really maintainable and will probably change.
