# Rackspace Container Service

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) repo housing documentation and tutorials for Rackspace Container Service

## Installation
You can either install Jekyll using the instructions below or if you have Docker Toolbox installed, just run `script/preview`.

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
1. Clone this repository
1. From the cloned repo, run `bundle install`
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch`
1. Navigate your web browser to the URL the command displays

Jekyll is now serving this repo as a simple website, and will re-build the site every time you save a file.

## Writing

The content is split into three separate collections: **tutorials**, **best practices**, and **references**. The individual files for these collections are in `_tutorials`, `_best-practices`, and `_references`, respectively.

Right now, file names are being prefixed with a number like `001-` to control their display order. This is not really maintainable and will probably change.
